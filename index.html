            Hi! My name is Sara Pereira. currently I live in Phoenix, Arizona which is a huge change <br/>
            from where I am usually from - The Azores - these are islands in the middle of the Atlantic. <br/>
            I have two degrees; one is on Cinema Production from Paris, and the other is on Social and Cultural Analysis
            from ASU. They seem very different, but what they have in common is that both these degrees are about
            understanding how things work. This is why I have decided to change my career and pursue Web Development. 
            It's the ultimate puzzle!
